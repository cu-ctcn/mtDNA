MT variant calling pipeline based on Broad's GATK best practice MT pipeline.
Scripts point to the files from the ROSMAP dataset, but the identical
pipeline was applied to the Mayo and MSBB datasets.

1) generateMTbams.sh
Reads original bam files from the dataset folder and Creates an MT
bam file and a shifted MT bam file for each sample in the bam folder.

2a) collectMetrics.sh
Reads the MT bam file (not the shifted one) and runs the haplochecker
and picards collect WGS metrics. Output is written into the bam folder.
(WGS metrics are currently not further used in the pipeline)

2b) collectMetrics.R
Reads results from the haplochecker and the median autosomal
coverage as calculated in the ../mtCopyNumber folder and writes
the file mtMetrics.csv into the scripts folder that is used in step 3.

3) callVariants.sh
Runs Mutect2 on the MT and shifted MT bam files, merges the VCF files
and writes per samples VCFs into the vcf folder.

4) makeVcfFileLists.R
Writes text files listing the locations of the single vcf files into
the scripts/vcfFileLists folder. Text files are splitted by tissue/brain
region. Files are used in step 5.

5) combineVcf.sh
Runs the bcftools to merge single-sample vcf files. vcf files are
generated for each tissue/brain region in addition to one overall vcf
file. Files are written to vcf/merged

6) summarizeResults.R
Reads qc metrics from haplochecker and calculates some sample level
stats (total number of homoplasmies and heteroplasmies) and writes
results to values/variants.csv.
